# Dataquest's Guided Project
# Clean-and-Analyze-Employees-Exit-Survey

We will work with exit survey from employees of the [Departement of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland))(DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Quensland, Australia. [Here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) the TAFE exit survey and [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey) the survey for the DETE.

In this project we would like to answer the following questions:

* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? what about employees who have been there longer?

* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

we will use _both_ surveys to answer these questions
